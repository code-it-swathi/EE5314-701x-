# 701x IMU Data Challenge
Thank you for your interest in joining the Embedded Software Team at 701x! We
are excited to get to know you better.

Please demonstrate your problem solving skills by completing the following
challenge. Be prepared to walk us through your solution and explain your work.

## The Challenge
701x smart ear tags use inertial measurement units (IMUs) to monitor animal
behavior. The software embedded inside each tag processes data from the sensor
in real-time to alert the rancher quickly when anomalies occur.

For this challenge, you must use acceleration data collected from an ear tag to
create an algorithm that estimates the amount of time an animal spends sleeping
or resting during the day.

### Step 1: Analysis
Write a Python program to analyze the sample data found in `acceleration.csv`.
Identify periods where the animal appears to be sleeping or resting. Plot your
results.

### Step 2: Implementation
Translate your Python algorithm into C by implementing the functions declared in
`imu.h`. Compile and run the code in `main.c` to test your implementation.

_The code provided in `main.c` and `imu.h` serves as a starting point to
expedite your work. It is not intended to be a restriction. Feel free to add to
or modify it however you wish!_

## Hints
* Please note that there is no single "correct" answer for this problem. We are
looking for a _reasonable_ solution, not a specific numerical result.
* Keep in mind that the best solution is often a simple one, especially when
developing for a microcontroller with limited resources.
* Please do not exhaust yourself by spending too much time on this challenge. If
you get really stuck on one particular aspect of it, try to continue on anyway,
but be prepared to explain how you would have proceeded if you had more time.

**Good luck!**
